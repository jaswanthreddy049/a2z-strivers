"""A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2."""class Solution(object):
    def findPeakElement(self, nums):
        start=0
        end=len(nums)-1
        while(start<end):
            mid=(start+end)//2
            if nums[mid]<nums[mid+1]:
                start=mid+1
            else:
                end=mid
